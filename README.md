Exercise questions for Tesla

Requirements to run the project
    -> requirements.txt

Python code
    -> exercise1.pdf for first question (Had a thought of implementing async processing for the service calls but thought its an overkill)
    -> product.py for second question

Docker-compose file:
    docker-compose.yml (Had to take google help for this)

Git commands:
Clone the repo to local
	Git clone {source_location}

Creating a branch for feature:
 	git checkout {feature_branch_name}

Perform the code changes:

	git add.
	git commit
	git push

Changes will be in feature branch

Create pull request from develop to feature to perform code review and code merge

Once code is in dev branch, devops jobs will move the changes to higher environments
